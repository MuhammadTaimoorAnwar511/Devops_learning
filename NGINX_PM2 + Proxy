Deploy React App with NGINX (Ubuntu) - Clean Setup
Step 1: Install NGINX
nginx -v                         # Check if nginx is installed
sudo apt update                  # Update package lists
sudo apt install nginx -y        # Install nginx
sudo systemctl status nginx      # Check nginx status
sudo systemctl start nginx       # Start nginx
sudo systemctl enable nginx      # Enable nginx to start at boot

sudo npm install -g serve pm2    #Install serve and pm2

Step 2: Set Up React App
mkdir <project-folder>
cd <project-folder>

# Clone a specific branch OR pull it if already initialized
git clone -b <branch-name> <git-repo-url>
# or
git pull origin <branch-name>

cd < project-folder >

# Install dependencies and build the React app
npm install
npm run build

Ensure that a build/ folder is created in your React app directory. This is what Nginx will serve.

pm2 start "serve -s build -l <3002>" --name <app-name>
