Let’s walk through the step-by-step GUI process to deploy your 2-tier Flask + MySQL ECS app using a custom VPC, public/private subnets, Load Balancer, Listener, and Target Group via the AWS Console.
✅ Prerequisites
Before starting, make sure:
Docker images (mysql and taimooranwar/flaskapp:latest) are ready.

You have the ecsTaskExecutionRole IAM role created.

You’re deploying in AWS Fargate mode.

🔧 Step 1: Create Custom VPC, Subnets, and Internet Gateway
🛠 Go to VPC Dashboard
Click on “Create VPC”.
select: vpc only
Name tag: twotier-vpc

IPv4 CIDR block: 10.0.0.0/16

Tenancy: Default
click create vpc 
go to subnets 

Create Two Public Subnets

Name: public-subnet-1, CIDR: 10.0.1.0/24, AZ: us-east-1a

Name: public-subnet-2, CIDR: 10.0.2.0/24, AZ: us-east-1b

Create Two Private Subnets

Name: private-subnet-1, CIDR: 10.0.3.0/24, AZ: us-east-1a

Name: private-subnet-2, CIDR: 10.0.4.0/24, AZ: us-east-1b

Create Internet Gateway

Name: twotier-igw

Attach to twotier-vpc

Create Route Table for Public Subnets

Name: twotier-public-rt

Add route: 0.0.0.0/0 → Internet Gateway

Associate with both public subnets

Create Route Table for Private Subnets

Name: twotier-private-rt

No route to internet

Associate with both private subnets

🔒 Step 2: Create Security Groups
📦 For MySQL:
Name: mysql-sg

Inbound rules:

TCP 3306 → Custom: Flask SG (or 0.0.0.0/0 for now to test)

Outbound: Allow all

🧠 For Flask:
Name: flask-sg

Inbound rules:

TCP 5000 → 0.0.0.0/0 (for direct browser access)

Or later, connect via ALB listener

Outbound: Allow all

📋 Step 3: Create Target Groups
🎯 Go to EC2 → Target Groups → Create target group
MySQL doesn't need this. Just for Flask (HTTP):

Target type: IP

Protocol: HTTP, Port: 5000

VPC: twotier-vpc

Name: flask-tg

🌐 Step 4: Create Application Load Balancer
Go to EC2 → Load Balancers → Create Load Balancer

Type: Application Load Balancer

Name: flask-alb

Scheme: Internet-facing

Listeners: HTTP, port 80

VPC: twotier-vpc

Subnets: Select both public subnets

Security Group for ALB

Name: alb-sg

Inbound rule: TCP 80 → 0.0.0.0/0

Outbound: Allow all

Target Group (Use one created earlier): flask-tg

🧱 Step 5: ECS Setup
Step 5.1: MySQL Task Definition
Task family: twotier_task_sql

Image: mysql:5.7

Ports: 3306

Env Vars: DB values

Use private subnets and no public IP

Attach mysql-sg

Step 5.2: Flask Task Definition
Task family: twotier_task_flask

Image: taimooranwar/flaskapp:latest

Ports: 5000

Env Vars: Use IP of MySQL private IP

Use private subnets and no public IP

Attach flask-sg

🔁 Step 6: ECS Services (Use Custom Networking)
MySQL Service:
Cluster: twotier_cluster

Task Definition: twotier_task_sql

Service Name: twotier-service_sql

Networking:

Launch Type: Fargate

VPC: twotier-vpc

Subnets: Private

Security group: mysql-sg

Public IP: Disabled

Flask Service:
Cluster: twotier_cluster

Task Definition: twotier_task_flask

Service Name: twotier-service_flask

Networking:

Launch Type: Fargate

VPC: twotier-vpc

Subnets: Private

Security group: flask-sg

Public IP: Disabled

Attach to flask-tg (target group)

Register targets automatically with IP

🧪 Step 7: Test Your Deployment
Go to Load Balancer DNS

Copy DNS name of ALB from EC2 → Load Balancers

Open: http://<ALB-DNS-Name>/

Let me know if you also want to:
Add HTTPS (SSL) via ACM.

🧹 STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE TO DELETE EVERYTHING

✅ STEP 1: Delete ECS Services
Go to: Amazon ECS > Clusters > twotier_cluster
Click on twotier-service_flask

Click Delete (top-right button)

Confirm

Click on twotier-service_sql

Click Delete

Confirm

📝 Wait until both services show status: INACTIVE.

✅ STEP 2: Delete ECS Task Definitions
Go to: Amazon ECS > Task Definitions
Click on twotier_task_flask → Deregister all revisions.

Click on twotier_task_sql → Deregister all revisions.

✅ STEP 3: Delete ECS Cluster
Go to: Amazon ECS > Clusters
Select twotier_cluster

Click Delete Cluster

Confirm

✅ STEP 4: Delete Load Balancer and Target Group
🔸 Load Balancer
Go to: EC2 > Load Balancers
Select flask-alb

Click Actions > Delete

Confirm

🔸 Target Group
Go to: EC2 > Target Groups
Select flask-tg

Click Actions > Delete

Confirm

✅ STEP 5: Delete Custom VPC and Networking
Go to: VPC Dashboard
5.1: Detach and Delete Internet Gateway
Select twotier-igw

Click Actions > Detach from VPC

Then Delete

5.2: Delete Route Tables
Delete twotier-public-rt

Delete twotier-private-rt

5.3: Delete Subnets
Delete all 4:

public-subnet-1

public-subnet-2

private-subnet-1

private-subnet-2

5.4: Delete VPC
Select twotier-vpc

Click Delete VPC

✅ STEP 6: Delete Security Groups
Go to: VPC > Security Groups
Delete:

flask-sg

mysql-sg

alb-sg

⚠️ Make sure they’re not attached to anything before deleting.

✅ STEP 7: Optional Cleanup
🔹 IAM Role (if created manually)
Go to: IAM > Roles
If you created a custom role for ECS (other than ecsTaskExecutionRole), delete it.

🔹 CloudWatch Logs
Go to: CloudWatch > Logs > Log groups
Delete any log groups related to your ECS tasks (e.g., /ecs/twotier_task_flask)

✅ Final Cost Check (Recommended)
Go to: Billing Dashboard
Check for any running resources.

Use Cost Explorer to ensure nothing is charging.

Enable autoscaling.

Add CloudWatch monitoring.
